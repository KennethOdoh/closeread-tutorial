    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Scrollytelling?\n",
    "Scrollytelling is a dynamic, interactive storytelling technique often used in web-based formats, that reveals insights, visuals, and narrative elements as the user scrolls down the page. It allows data stories to unfold gradually, guiding the reader through a structured narrative in a way that feels both natural and engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Scrollytelling Is Effective for Data Communication\n",
    "Scrollytelling is a powerful way to communicate data because it helps reduce information overload, boosts user engagement, and makes insights easier to digest. Rather than overwhelming users with dense dashboards or complex visuals all at once, it guides them through your story step by step—just by scrolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrollytelling is not a replacement for other presentation methods such as dashboards and static pdf reports. Instead, it works best when there’s a need to communicate stories or data insights to a broad audience with varying levels of data literacy. It allows each insight to be wrapped in meaningful context and empowers you the author to control the pacing and structure of your narrative while keeping readers engaged through suspense and sequential reveals. This results in a smoother, more intuitive experience, especially for readers who need guidance or are less data-savvy. This level of engagement is often difficult to achieve with other traditional methods of presentation. As a dynamic and versatile technique, scrollytelling supports various content formats such as text, charts, maps, GIFs, images and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "Despite its many advantages, scrollytelling has traditionally required web development skills—something many data analysts and scientists don’t typically have. In the past, even large media houses with dedicated teams would spend significant time and effort building a scrollytelling project. The tradeoffs were high, making it a less viable option for time-sensitive or resource-constrained projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For smaller teams or solo practitioners, this barrier has often made web-based storytelling feel out of reach. But that changes today. Thanks to the many developer communities, the barriers have been so significantly lowered that you can put up your scrollytelling project in a few hours, many of the times, without even needing to code! \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll Learn in This Tutorial\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to build and deploy a fully functional data scrollytelling project—taking your insights beyond dashboards and onto the web! Specifically, you’ll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up your environment and craft your data story using the scrollytelling technique\n",
    "- Build your project locally and deploy it to the web for free using GitHub and Vercel (or any other deployment platform that supports dynamic webpages)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t worry—we’ll walk through everything step by step, from scratch. Whether you’re an absolute beginner or just looking to sharpen your skills, this tutorial will help you build your first scrollytelling project from the ground up!\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing: This tutorial is designed to be hands-on, so as you follow along, feel free to copy each line of code and paste it into your Closeread document to see it in action."

    "## Tools We’ll Be Using\n",
    "For this project, we’ll use the [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/) extension to create our data scrollytelling experience. Closeread is a Quarto extension designed specifically for building interactive, scroll-based narratives. To use Closeread, you’ll need two key tools:\n",
    "1. **Quarto**: an open-source publishing system that supports Python, R, Julia, and ObservableJS. It allows you to create dynamic, multi-format documents using Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, or your preferred editor. Since Closeread is built on top of Quarto, installing Quarto is a necessary first step.\n",
    "2. **A Code Editor**: This is where you’ll write and manage your project files. We’ll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in this tutorial, but feel free to use alternatives like RStudio, Atom, or any editor that supports Quarto projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, install the Quarto  command line tool from the official [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/download/). Follow the standard installation process for your operating system. Since I'm using Windows, I downloaded it as shown below.\n",
    "![GIF shows how to download Quarto from the website](assets/download_quarto.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy the final project to the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve installed Quarto, you’re ready to install the Closeread extension. We’ll cover that in the next section."

    "**Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory**  \n",
    "Start by creating a folder named `closeread_tutorial`. You can place this folder anywhere you'd like your project to live. Personally, I prefer to keep it on my Desktop, so my directory structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\closeread_tutorial\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd \"C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\closeread_tutorial\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "quarto add qmd-lab/closeread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you're connected to the internet, as this command will fetch the extension from an online repository. You may receive a few prompts asking whether Quarto extensions should be allowed to execute code during document rendering. Simply type `Yes` for each prompt to proceed with the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your command prompt should now look similar to this:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Understand the Building Blocks of Closeread\n",
    "\n",
    "A Closeread project is built as a section within a Quarto document, defined using **fenced divs**. At its core, a Closeread section consists of three main components: **Section**, **Sticky**, and **Trigger**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Section  \n",
    "A **Closeread section** is created using opening and closing fenced divs with the `.cr-section` class. This defines the scrollytelling block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the simplest Closeread section looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{.cr-section}\n",
    "This is a Closeread section\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section can be enhanced with **stickies** (content that remains fixed while the user scrolls) and **triggers** (content that appears or changes as the user scrolls). We'll explore those next.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Pro Tip:** If you wrap your entire Quarto document in a fenced div with the `.cr-section` class, the whole thing becomes a Closeread document 😉  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> This means everything in your document becomes part of the scrollytelling experience—great for fully immersive data stories!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stickies\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sticky** is an element within a Closeread section. It could be a block of text, an image, a video, or any element that can be rendered in the browser. It's the element you want to perform *closeread* on. This means you can set it to **stick** to the screen as the reader scrolls through the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stickies can also be made **invisible by default**, and only appear when the viewer scrolls to the point where the **trigger** is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare an element as a sticky, wrap it within a fenced div and assign it an identifier prefixed with `cr-`, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{#cr-identifier}\n",
    "This block of text is a sticky!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sticky must be enclosed within a section, the full code would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{.cr-section}\n",
    "This is a Closeread section\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{#cr-identifier}\n",
    "This block of text is a sticky within the Closeread section!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might already know, a **trigger** is the element that activates a sticky in a Closeread document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the `cr-identifier` we assigned to the sticky above? The one prefixed with `cr-`? That’s the element we’ll use to trigger the sticky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how triggering works:\n",
    "- Identify the point in your document where you want the sticky to be activated.\n",
    "- At that point, reference the sticky’s identifier—just replace the `cr-` prefix with `@`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `cr-identifier` becomes `@identifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s update our full code to include a trigger:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{.cr-section}\n",
    "This is a Closeread section\n",
    "\n",
    "I want my sticky to appear here ➡️ @cr-identifier\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{#cr-identifier}\n",
    "This block of text is a sticky within the Closeread section!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple, right? When a reader scrolls to the trigger (`@identifier`), the sticky pops into view!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, copy the updated code and paste it into your `my_first_closeread.qmd` file, replacing everything after the line that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hello World! Please read my Closeread story below.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your document should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: My First Closeread\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-render the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've updated your `index.qmd` file with the new code, open your terminal and run the quarto render command just like before:\n",

    "\n",
    "If you’d like to further customize your Closeread project using an external `.css` stylesheet, you can follow the standard approach used in regular web development: by assigning styles directly to elements. All you need to do is link your Closeread document to the external stylesheet—and you’ll do this in the YAML section of the document (the part enclosed by triple dashes).\n",

    "  .narrative {\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve followed this tutorial up to this point, you should now be familiar with how to build a scrollytelling project from scratch using Closeread. You’ve learned the core building blocks of a Closeread project—such as sections, stickies, and triggers. You’ve also explored how to style your project using both built-in options and external CSS files. And finally, you now know how to host your project on GitHub and deploy it with Vercel, so your story can go live and be shared with the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you a solid foundation for taking your data storytelling skills to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up next is the second part of this tutorial, where you’ll build an actual scrollytelling project. The script and accompanying images have been provided for you. The goal of this project is to help you reinforce what you’ve just learned by applying it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the next section, you should be able to confidently piece together everything we’ve covered and create your own version of an interactive scrollytelling project like [this one](#)."
