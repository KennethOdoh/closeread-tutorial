    "## Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "### What is Scrollytelling?\n",
    "Scrollytelling is a dynamic, interactive storytelling technique often used in web-based formats, that reveals insights, visuals, and narrative elements as the user scrolls down the page. It allows data stories to unfold gradually, guiding the reader through a structured narrative in a way that feels both natural and engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Scrollytelling Is Effective for Data Communication\n",
    "Scrollytelling is a powerful way to communicate data because it helps reduce information overload, boosts user engagement, and makes insights easier to digest. Rather than overwhelming users with dense dashboards or complex visuals all at once, it guides them through your story step by step—just by scrolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a dynamic and flexible technique, scrollytelling supports various content formats such as text, charts, maps, GIFs, and images. It empowers you, the author, to control the pacing and structure of your narrative while keeping readers engaged through suspense and sequential reveals. This method not only presents data but also wraps it in meaningful context, helping readers connect the dots without confusion. There's no guesswork—no need to click, swipe, or explore aimlessly. Just scroll, and the story unfolds. Compared to traditional dashboards, which often present too much information at once, scrollytelling offers a smoother, more intuitive experience—especially for readers who need guidance or aren't data-savvy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "Despite its many advantages, scrollytelling has traditionally required web development skills—something many data analysts and scientists don’t typically have. In the past, even large media houses with dedicated teams would spend significant time and effort building a scrollytelling project. The tradeoffs were high, making it a less viable option for time-sensitive or resource-constrained projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For smaller teams or solo practitioners, this barrier has often made web-based storytelling feel out of reach. But that changes today. Thanks to the many developer communities, the barriers have been so significantly lowered that you can put up your scrollytelling project in a few hours, many of the times, without even needing to code! \n",
    "\n",
    "What You’ll Learn in This Tutorial\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to build and deploy a fully functional data scrollytelling project—taking your insights beyond dashboards and onto the web!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here’s what you’ll learn:**\n",
    "- How to set up your environment and craft your data story using the scrollytelling technique\n",
    "- How to build your project locally and deploy it to the web for free using GitHub and Vercel\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t worry if this sounds new—we’ll walk through everything step by step, from scratch. Whether you're an absolute beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, you'll end up with a real, portfolio-ready project you can proudly share."

    "## Tools We’ll Be Using\n",
    "For this project, we’ll use the Closeread library to create our data scrollytelling experience. Closeread is a Quarto extension designed specifically for building interactive, scroll-based narratives. To use Closeread, you’ll need two key tools:\n",
    "1. Quarto – an open-source publishing system that supports Python, R, Julia, and ObservableJS. It allows you to create dynamic, multi-format documents using Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, or your preferred editor. Since Closeread is built on top of Quarto, installing Quarto is a necessary first step.\n",
    "2. A Code Editor – This is where you’ll write and manage your project files. We’ll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in this tutorial, but feel free to use alternatives like RStudio, Atom, or any editor that supports Quarto projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, install Quarto from the official [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/download/). Follow the standard installation process for your operating system. Since I'm using Windows, I downloaded it as shown below.\n",
    "![GIF shows how to download Quarto from the website](assets/download_quarto.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also be using GitHub for version control and Vercel to deploy the final project to the web. Don’t worry—we’ll walk through setting up both platforms when the time comes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve installed Quarto, you’re ready to install the Closeread extension. We’ll cover that in the next section."

    "---  \n",
    "**Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory**  \n",
    "Start by creating a folder named `closeread_tutorial`. You can place this folder anywhere you'd like your project to live. Personally, I prefer to keep it on my Desktop, so my directory structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\closeread_tutorial\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, open a terminal and navigate to the folder you just created. An easy way to do this is by copying the full path to the folder.\n",

    "If you're on Windows, press **Windows Key + R**, type `cmd`, and hit Enter to open the Command Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, run the following command (update the path to match your own folder location if different):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd \"C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\closeread_tutorial\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "quarto add qmd-lab/closeread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you're connected to the internet, as this command will fetch the extension from an online repository. Depending on the speed of your connection, the installation might take a few moments. You may receive a few prompts asking whether Quarto extensions should be allowed to execute code during document rendering. Simply type Yes for each prompt to proceed with the installation.\n",

    "## Understand the Building Blocks of Closeread\n",
    "\n",
    "A Closeread project is built as a section within a Quarto document, defined using **fenced divs**. At its core, a Closeread section consists of three main components: **Section**, **Sticky**, and **Trigger**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Section  \n",
    "A **Closeread section** is created using opening and closing fenced divs with the `.cr-section` class. This defines the scrollytelling block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the simplest Closeread section looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{.cr-section}\n",
    "This is a Closeread section\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section can be enhanced with **stickies** (content that remains fixed while the user scrolls) and **triggers** (content that appears or changes as the user scrolls). We'll explore those next.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Pro Tip:** If you wrap your entire Quarto document in a fenced div with the `.cr-section` class, the whole thing becomes a Closeread document 😉  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> This means everything in your document becomes part of the scrollytelling experience—great for fully immersive data stories!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stickies\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sticky** is an element within a Closeread section. It could be a block of text, an image, a video, or any element that can be rendered in the browser. It's the element you want to perform *closeread* on. This means you can set it to **stick** to the screen as the reader scrolls through the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stickies can also be made **invisible by default**, and only appear when the viewer scrolls to the point where the **trigger** is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare an element as a sticky, wrap it within a fenced div and assign it an identifier prefixed with `cr-`, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{#cr-identifier}\n",
    "This block of text is a sticky!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sticky must be enclosed within a section, the full code would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{.cr-section}\n",
    "This is a Closeread section\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{#cr-identifier}\n",
    "This block of text is a sticky within the Closeread section!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might already know, a **trigger** is the element that activates a sticky in a Closeread document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the `cr-identifier` we assigned to the sticky above? The one prefixed with `cr-`? That’s the element we’ll use to trigger the sticky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how triggering works:\n",
    "- Identify the point in your document where you want the sticky to be activated.\n",
    "- At that point, reference the sticky’s identifier—just replace the `cr-` prefix with `@`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `cr-identifier` becomes `@identifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s update our full code to include a trigger:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ":::{.cr-section}\n",
    "This is a Closeread section\n",
    "\n",
    "I want my sticky to appear here → @cr-identifier\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{#cr-identifier}\n",
    "This block of text is a sticky within the Closeread section!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple, right? When a reader scrolls to the trigger (`@identifier`), the sticky pops into view!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, copy the updated code and paste it into your `my_first_closeread.qmd` file, replacing everything after the line that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hello World! Please read my Closeread story below.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your document should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: My First Closeread\n",
    "format: closeread-html\n",
    "\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the Preview Command:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've updated your `my_first_closeread.qmd` file with the new code, open your terminal and run the preview command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "quarto preview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will launch your project in the browser and you’ll see the updated Closeread project. As you scroll, your sticky will appear at the specified trigger point!\n",

    "## Adding Styling and Interactivity to Your Closeread Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Closeread offers several options for styling your project. You can choose from the various theme options provided by Quarto, create your own custom CSS, or use a combination of both. You can declare the styling template in the YAML configuration section of your document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Closeread [styling documentation](https://closeread.dev/guide/styling#:~:text=Styling-,Styling,fixed%20value%2C%20or%20a%20combination%20of%20the%20two%20using%20minmax().,-(S)CSS%20customisation) provides a detailed guide on how to style your document—use it as a reference. For this project, let’s apply some of these techniques to further customize our document.\n",

    "#### Applying custom CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to further customize your Closeread project using an external `.css` stylesheet, you can follow the standard approach used in regular web development: by assigning styles directly to elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, let's change the color of the text in the **narrative section** of our Closeread project. The narrative section is the part of your story that delivers the main content. By default, the text appears black on desktop. We want to change it to **white**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Within the root of your project directory, create a new empty file and name it `style.css`.\n",
    "- Paste the following lines of code into the file and save it:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  .narrative {\n",
    "    color: white;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, reference the external CSS file in your Closeread document. You can do this by navigating to the YAML configuration section of your document and pasting the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```markdown\n",
    "  css: style.css\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take note of the indentation!** Your YAML section should now look like this:\n",
