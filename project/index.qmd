Hello World! Please read my Closeread story below.

:::{.cr-section}
This is a Closeread section

I want my sticky to appear here ‚û°Ô∏è @cr-identifier

:::{#cr-identifier}
This block of text is a sticky within the Closeread section!
:::

Below is another block of text we'll be working with:
@cr-highlighted <!-- @cr-highlighted refers to a block of text defined below with the identifier 'cr-highlighted'. -->

First, let's scale this block of text by two:
[@cr-highlighted]{scale-by="2"}

Next, we‚Äôll highlight lines 2 and 3 while keeping the same scale:
[@cr-highlighted]{scale-by="2" highlight="2-3"}

Now, let‚Äôs bring in an image:
@cr-image

It‚Äôs a bit large at first‚Äîtaking up the full screen. Let‚Äôs scale it down:
[@cr-image]{scale-by="0.5"}

Finally, we‚Äôll pan to the portion highlighted in red:
[@cr-image2]{pan-to="-75%,75%" scale-by="1.5"}

>üí°Pro tip: When you `pan` and `scale` at the same time, you end up `zooming`!

**Note**: Panning can be a bit unintuitive at first. You might need to experiment with the position values to get the result you want. A bit of trial and error helps here.

:::{#cr-highlighted}
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ This is the first line.
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ This is the second line.
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ This is the third line.
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ And this is the fourth line.
